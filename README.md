# PyUAVSim
Light weight Python simulator for small UAVs

Work in progress (development is slow since I am doing this part time) - The current plan is to release the first complete version by March 2017. I am looking for contributors. If you are interested, email me.

Completed Feature List:
1. Autopilot for fixed wing
2. Sensors (GPS, IMU) with error models
3. Path following and Path manager implemented
4. Changed interfaces so that Users can write apps with the base classes provided

Next set of features:

1. State estimation using kalman filter/variants
2. Pathplanner class with RRT 
3. Wind models is not there due to their slightly complex nature - this will be added at the very end
4. support for quard rotors
