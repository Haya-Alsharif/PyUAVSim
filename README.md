# PyUAVSim
Light weight Python simulator for small UAVs
Work in progress (development is slow since I am doing this part time as hobby)

Completed Feature List:
1. Autopilot for fixed wing
2. Sensors (GPS, IMU) with error models

Next set of features:

1. Change interfaces so that a user can write UAVApp
2. State estimation using kalman filter/variants
3. Reduced order UAV kinematics and autopilot model to enable path planning
4. Pathplanner class with RRT 
5. Wind models is not there due to their slightly complex nature - this will be added at the very end
