# PyUAVSim
Light weight Python simulator for small UAVs that will support design and development of UAS (from autopilot tuning to path planning)
Work in progress (development is slow since I am doing this part time as hobby)

Next set of features:
1. Autopilot for fixed wing
2. Change interfaces so that a user can write UAVApp
3. Sensors (GPS, IMU) with error models
4. State estimation using kalman filter/variants
5. Reduced order UAV kinematics and autopilot model to enable path planning
6. Pathplanner class with RRT 
7. Wind models is not there due to their slightly complex nature - this will be added at the very end
