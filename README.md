# PyUAVSim
Light weight Python simulator for small UAVs
Work in progress (development is slow since I am doing this part time as hobby)

Completed Feature List:
1. Autopilot for fixed wing
2. Sensors (GPS, IMU) with error models
3. Path following and Path maanger implemented
4. Changed interfaces so that Users can write apps with the base classes provided

Next set of features:

1. State estimation using kalman filter/variants
2. Pathplanner class with RRT 
3. Wind models is not there due to their slightly complex nature - this will be added at the very end
